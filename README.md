# Lidar-Emulator-Rain
This is the Lidar Emulator considering rainfall effect using Unity3d. This emulator can produce the lidar simulation data considering the rainfall effect for Lidar sensor. We constructed the simple simulation environment using RoadRunner, Matlab.

## Effects by rainfall 
Lidar sensor is affected 


1) Intensity Attenuation 
    
3) Unwanted Noise Effect
